# Reviewing Product Strategy

Evaluates product strategy documents for quality, completeness, and coherence. Identifies issues and suggests improvements.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Read the Strategy Document

Read the complete strategy document and any referenced vision document.

### Step 2: Evaluate Content Quality

Score each dimension 0-3:

| Dimension | 0 (Missing) | 1 (Weak) | 2 (Adequate) | 3 (Strong) |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Market Specificity** | No market defined | "Everyone" or too broad | Named segment | Specific, reachable beachhead |
| **GTM Clarity** | No GTM plan | Vague channels | Clear motion | Staged plan with metrics |
| **Competitive Honesty** | No competitors | Dismissive | Fair assessment | Honest, cedes ground |
| **Business Viability** | No model | Wishful math | Basic economics | Unit economics validated |
| **Roadmap Quality** | No roadmap | Feature list | Outcome-based | Outcomes + confidence levels |
| **Risk Awareness** | No risks | Trivial risks | Real risks listed | Risks with credible mitigations |

**Score interpretation:**
- 15-18: Strong strategy, minor refinements
- 10-14: Solid foundation, needs work in specific areas
- 5-9: Significant gaps, major revision needed
- 0-4: Fundamental issues, restart recommended

### Step 3: Evaluate Structural Quality

Check each element:

| Element | Pass | Fail |
|---------|------|------|
| **Target Market section** | Specific beachhead + expansion | Missing or "everyone" |
| **Go-to-Market section** | Clear motion and stages | Missing or vague |
| **Competitive Strategy** | Positioning + honest assessment | Missing or dismissive |
| **Business Model** | Pricing + unit economics | Missing or no math |
| **Roadmap** | Now/Next/Later with outcomes | Missing or feature list |
| **Risk Assessment** | Real risks with mitigations | Missing or all "low" |
| **Success Metrics** | Measurable targets | Missing or vague |
| **Appropriate length** | 200-500 lines | Too short or bloated |

### Step 4: Check Vision Alignment

Verify strategy supports vision:

- [ ] Target market matches problem from vision
- [ ] Competitive positioning leverages vision's differentiators
- [ ] Solution approach consistent with vision
- [ ] No contradictions between vision and strategy
- [ ] Strategy achieves vision's aspirational outcome

### Step 5: Stress Test Key Claims

For each major claim, ask:

**Market claims:**
- How do we know this segment has this problem?
- How do we reach them?
- Is the market size credible?

**Competitive claims:**
- Is our positioning genuinely different?
- Are we honest about where we're weaker?
- Is our moat defensible?

**Business claims:**
- Does the math work (LTV > 3x CAC)?
- Are assumptions stated?
- Are projections grounded?

**Roadmap claims:**
- Are "Now" items actually achievable?
- Are "Next" dependencies realistic?
- Are "Later" items too speculative?

### Step 6: Identify Anti-Patterns

Check for common problems:

| Anti-Pattern | How to Detect | Severity |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Boil the Ocean** | Market is "everyone" or extremely broad | High |
| **Feature Roadmap** | Roadmap lists features, not outcomes | High |
| **Competitor Dismissal** | "We're better at everything" | High |
| **Hockey Stick** | Revenue projections spike without basis | Medium |
| **Risk Blindness** | No risks or all marked "low" | Medium |
| **Buzzword Strategy** | "AI-first", "platform" without specifics | Medium |
| **Vision Confusion** | Strategy mixed with vision content | Low |

### Step 7: Generate Recommendations

Based on findings, provide:
1. **Strengths** - What's working well
2. **Issues** - Specific problems with examples
3. **Recommendations** - Concrete fixes
4. **Overall verdict** - Keep/Improve/Revise/Restart

## Quality Criteria Deep Dive

### Market Specificity

**Strong:**

**Questions to ask:**
- Can we name 10 specific potential customers?

- Why will they buy from us vs alternatives?

### GTM Clarity

**Strong:**
- Clear acquisition motion (product-led vs sales-led)
- Staged approach with different focuses
- Channel strategy for each stage
- Success metrics per stage

**Weak:**
- Vague "marketing and sales"
- No staging or evolution
- No channel specifics
- No metrics

**Questions to ask:**
- How does a customer go from unaware to paying?
- What's the first interaction?
- How do we scale acquisition?

### Competitive Honesty

**Strong:**
- Names specific competitors
- Explains their positioning fairly
- Identifies where we're weaker
- Claims specific scenarios where we win
- Acknowledges moat limitations

**Weak:**
- "No direct competitors"
- Dismisses competitors as inferior

- Ignores substitute solutions

**Questions to ask:**
- What would a competitor say about us?

- Why hasn't someone else done this?

### Business Viability

**Strong:**
- Clear pricing with rationale
- Unit economics calculated (CAC, LTV)
- LTV:CAC > 3:1 or explanation
- Assumptions stated explicitly
- Conservative and optimistic scenarios

**Weak:**
- "We'll figure out pricing later"
- No unit economics
- Magical revenue projections
- Hidden assumptions
- Only optimistic scenario

**Questions to ask:**
- How much to acquire a customer?
- How much will they pay over time?
- When do we break even?

### Roadmap Quality

**Strong:**
- Outcomes, not just outputs
- Confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- Dependencies acknowledged
- Open questions stated
- Pivot triggers defined

**Weak:**
- Feature lists without why
- No confidence differentiation
- Ignores dependencies
- Pretends certainty
- No exit criteria

**Questions to ask:**
- What outcome does this achieve?
- How confident are we?
- What would change this plan?

### Risk Awareness

**Strong:**
- Real risks that could kill the business
- Honest severity assessment
- Credible mitigations
- Monitoring triggers
- Acknowledges unknowns

**Weak:**

- False confidence

**Questions to ask:**
- What keeps you up at night?

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Market Too Broad

**Symptom:** Target market is "SMBs" or "healthcare companies" without specifics.

**Fix:** Narrow to specific beachhead:
- What sub-segment has the problem most acutely?
- How do we reach them specifically?
- Why can we win this segment?

### Issue: Feature Roadmap

**Symptom:** Roadmap lists features without explaining why.

**Example:** "Q1: User dashboard, Q2: API, Q3: Mobile app"

**Fix:** Rewrite as outcomes:
- What customer/business outcome does each enable?
- Use Now/Next/Later with confidence levels
- Include open questions and dependencies

### Issue: Competitor Dismissal

**Symptom:** Claims competitors are inferior or irrelevant.

**Example:** "Competitors don't understand the market like we do."

**Fix:** Honest assessment:
- Where are competitors actually strong?
- What scenarios would we lose?
- What's our specific counter-positioning?

### Issue: Hockey Stick Projections

**Symptom:** Revenue jumps dramatically without explanation.

**Example:** "Year 1: $100K, Year 2: $1M, Year 3: $10M"

**Fix:** Ground in assumptions:
- How many customers at each stage?
- What's the conversion rate?
- What enables the growth?

### Issue: Risk Blindness

**Symptom:** No risks listed, or all marked "low."

**Fix:** Honest risk assessment:
- What would cause this to fail?
- What don't we know?
- What depends on external factors?

### Issue: Missing Unit Economics

**Symptom:** Pricing stated but no CAC/LTV analysis.

**Fix:** Calculate and show:
- CAC: How much to acquire a customer?
- LTV: Revenue over customer lifetime
- LTV:CAC ratio (should be >3:1)
- Payback period
