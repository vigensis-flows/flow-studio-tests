# Creating Product Vision

Creates well-structured product vision documents that articulate where a product is going and why it matters.

## What is a Product Vision?

A product vision answers "Where are we going?" - the aspirational end state 3-5 years out.

**Vision is NOT strategy.** Strategy answers "How will we get there?" (market approach, go-to-market, roadmap). Keep them separate.

**Vision is NOT a feature list.** Features are outputs. Vision focuses on outcomes for customers and the market.

## Vision Document Structure

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Vision Statement** | Aspirational end state | 1-2 sentences |
| **Mission** | How we pursue the vision | 1-2 sentences |
| **The Problem** | Pain/opportunity that exists | 1-3 paragraphs |
| **The Solution** | Core insight and approach | 1-3 paragraphs |
| **What Makes This Different** | Key differentiators | 3-7 bullets |
| **Principles** | Guiding values/beliefs | 3-7 bullets |

### Optional Sections

| Section | When to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Target Customer** | When customer segment is clear |
| **Working Title Note** | When name may change |
| **Document History** | When tracking iterations |

**Target length:** 50-150 lines (1-3 pages)

## Creation Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before writing, understand:
- What sparked this idea? (problem observed, opportunity identified)
- Who has this problem? (target customer)
- What exists today? (current alternatives)
- What's the core insight? (why this approach is different)
- What's the founder's conviction? (beliefs driving this)

If context is unclear, ask clarifying questions before drafting.

### Step 2: Draft Vision Statement

The vision statement is the north star. It should be:
- **Aspirational** - describes a better future state
- **Specific** - not generic platitudes
- **Timebound** - achievable in 3-5 years
- **Customer-focused** - about their world, not your product

**Good patterns:**
- "[Customer segment] can [desirable outcome] through [our approach]"
- "Become the [category] for [segment] by [differentiation]"
- "[Verb] [outcome] for [customer] through [approach]"

**Examples from reference:**
- "Build professional services infrastructure that enables radical sustainable scaling through AI-augmented expertise."
- "Empower every healthcare sales professional with the intelligence they need to outperform."
- "MedComply becomes the essential developer productivity platform for medical device engineering teams."

### Step 3: Articulate the Problem

The problem section creates urgency. Structure as:

1. **Current state** - What's broken or missing today?
2. **Why it matters** - Impact on real people/businesses
3. **Why current solutions fail** - Gap in the market

**Good problem statements:**
- Specific and concrete (not abstract)
- Grounded in observation or research
- Significant enough to warrant a solution
- Not already solved well by others

### Step 4: Describe the Solution

The solution section explains the core insight. Structure as:

1. **Core insight** - The key realization that enables this
2. **Approach** - How you'll address the problem differently
3. **What you're building** - High-level description (not features)

**Keep it outcome-focused:**
- Bad: "We build an AI-powered platform with..."
- Good: "We enable [outcome] by [approach]..."

### Step 5: Define Differentiation

List 3-7 concrete differentiators. Each should:
- Be specific (not "better" or "faster")
- Be defensible (why competitors can't easily copy)
- Create customer value (not just technical novelty)

**Good differentiation:**
- "Active Intelligence: Experts create deliverables autonomously, not just provide advice"
- "B2C entry point: 20 CHF/month for individual reps while competitors sell B2B to enterprises"

**Bad differentiation:**
- "Better user experience"
- "AI-powered"
- "More features"

### Step 6: State Principles

Principles guide decisions when the vision doesn't provide clear answers. They should:
- Be actionable (can resolve real trade-offs)
- Be memorable (short, punchy)
- Reflect genuine beliefs (not generic values)

**Good principles:**
- "Outcomes over outputs: Measure by client success, not features shipped"
- "Build to learn: Each client project is a learning opportunity"
- "Product, not services: Every feature request gets evaluated as 'Can we productize this?'"

**Bad principles:**
- "Customer-focused"
- "High quality"
- "Innovative"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

### Content
- [ ] Vision is aspirational but achievable (3-5 year horizon)
- [ ] Problem is significant and specific (not trivial)
- [ ] Solution addresses the problem directly
- [ ] Differentiation is concrete and defensible
- [ ] Target customer is identifiable
- [ ] Principles guide real decisions

### Structure
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Vision statement is 1-2 sentences
- [ ] Total length 50-150 lines
- [ ] Scannable (headers, bullets, short paragraphs)

### Alignment
- [ ] All sections tell the same story
- [ ] No contradictions between sections
- [ ] Language is consistent throughout

### Red Flags (Fix Before Finalizing)
- [ ] No feature lists masquerading as vision
- [ ] No buzzword soup (AI, disruption, etc. without substance)
- [ ] No "boil the ocean" scope (trying to solve everything)
- [ ] No strategy elements (roadmap, metrics, go-to-market)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| **Feature Vision** | Lists features instead of outcomes | Rewrite focusing on customer value |
| **Technology Vision** | Leads with tech stack | Lead with customer problem/outcome |
| **Boil the Ocean** | Solves everything for everyone | Narrow to specific customer/problem |
| **Buzzword Bingo** | AI, blockchain, disruption without substance | Replace with specific capabilities |
| **Me-Too Vision** | "Like X but better" | Articulate unique insight |
| **Founder Fantasy** | Not grounded in market reality | Add problem evidence |
| **Strategy Creep** | Includes roadmap, metrics, GTM | Move to strategy document |
